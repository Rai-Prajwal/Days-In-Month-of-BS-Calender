## Usage

This repository provides a script to scrape calendar data for the Bikram Sambat (B.S.) calendar, as well as a pre-scraped data file (`daysinmonth.txt`) and (`bstoad.txt`) . If you only need the calendar data, you can directly refer to the data file without running the script.

To access the data:
1. Open `daysinmonth.txt`/`bstoad.txt` for a snapshot of the calendar data as of [2024/10/26].
2. Alternatively, run the script (`nepcal.py`) if you need the most recent data.

> **Note**: This data file is a static snapshot and may not reflect updates from the original website. Running the script may result in different data if the source website has been updated.
